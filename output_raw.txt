Title: Glimmer of Hope

In the heart of the deep night,

A gentle glow begins to bloom,
Iluminating the world's dark sight,
Bringing hope to hearts' inner room.

The stars sparkle in the sky,

Like a veil adorned with diamonds bright,
Each glimmer a beckoning cry,

To dream and hope with all our might.

The soft breeze caresses the trees,
Whispering tales of days gone by,
Birds sing in harmonious ease,
Celebrating life and paths that lie.

The scent of wild roses rise,

Perfuming the air with a promise sweet,
A tender kiss on each face applies,
Awakening souls from slumber's retreat.

Rivers flow, serene and calm,

Tracing their path with graceful dance,
Their melody, soothing like a balm,
Invites us to follow in a trance.

The mountains, majestic and proud,
Stand tall, witnessing eternity,
Guardians of Earth's secrets allowed,
Awakening our innate curiosity.

Dawn approaches, the night fades away,

A new day rises with grandeur,

Each sunrise a reason to sway,

And rekindle within us that glimmer of hope.
